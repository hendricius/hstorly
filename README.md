# Hstorly

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hendricius/hstorly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hendricius/hstorly)

This project is a fork of the amazing [bithavoc/multilang-hstore](https://github.com/bithavoc/multilang-hstore) with some remarkable differences.

* Focus on performance. Especially when dealing with millions of records,
  every operation counts.
* Remove a lot of features, focus on the core features.
* Due to focus on core features, better thread safety.

## Performance ##

**1,000,000 translation read operations**

```

**Setting a completely new object with translations 100,000 times**

hstorly:

```
  6.980000   0.020000   7.000000 (  7.000557)
```

```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hstorly'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hstorly

## Usage

This is a walkthrough with all steps you need to setup multilang translated attributes, including model and migration.

We're assuming here you want a Post model with some multilang attributes, as outlined below:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      hstore_translate :title
    end

The multilang translations are stored in the same model attributes (eg. title):

You may need to create migration for Post as usual, but multilang attributes should be in hstore type:

    create_table(:posts) do |t|
      t.hstore :title
      t.timestamps
    end

Thats it!

Now you are able to translate values for the attributes :title and :description per locale:

    I18n.locale = :en
    post.title = 'Hstorly rocks!'
    I18n.locale = :de
    post.title = 'Hstorly pferdefleisch!'

    I18n.locale = :en
    post.title #=> Hstorly rocks!
    I18n.locale = :de
    post.title #=> Hstorly pferdefleisch!

If this is not enough, and sometimes you want to access one of the attributes directly you can also do:

    post.title_en = 'Hulk > Time punch'
    post.title_en #=> Hulk > Time punch


You may use initialization if needed:

    Post.new(title: {en: 'Cows rock', de: 'KÃ¼he rocken'})

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
